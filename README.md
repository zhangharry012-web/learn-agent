# Learn Agent

A Python-based AI agent project that uses the shell as its command interaction layer.

`learn-agent` is intended as a lightweight starting point for building local agents that accept commands, execute shell tasks, manage basic session context, and return structured results. The repository is designed to be readable by both human developers and AI agents.

When `.env` contains valid LLM credentials, the agent routes user requests through the configured provider and exposes local tools:

- `read_file`: read local files directly without approval
- `write_file`: write local files after explicit human approval
- `edit_file`: edit local files through search-and-replace after explicit human approval
- `git_run`: execute git commands after explicit human approval
- `exec`: execute direct shell commands after explicit human approval

## Features

- Python implementation with a simple CLI entrypoint
- Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible provider support
- `.env`-based local configuration
- Tool-based local file and shell access
- Session-oriented interaction loop
- Clear separation between CLI, agent logic, and shell runner
- Basic safety policy for dangerous shell commands
- Structured observability logs under a dedicated log directory
- Minimal structure that is easy to extend

## Use Cases

- Build a local command-line AI assistant
- Prototype shell-capable automation agents
- Learn agent execution flow and tool orchestration
- Inspect LLM and runtime behavior through local observability logs
- Provide an AI-agent-friendly project skeleton for further development

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create local config

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

`.env` has the highest priority and is the only configuration source used by the app at runtime.
Do not commit `.env`.

Example Anthropic config:

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key
LLM_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED=true
OBSERVABILITY_LOG_DIR=logs/observability
OBSERVABILITY_PREVIEW_CHARS=2000
```

Example DeepSeek config:

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=deepseek
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key
LLM_MODEL=deepseek-chat
LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com
```

Backward-compatible Anthropic aliases are still supported in `.env`:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

### 4. Run the agent

```bash
python main.py
```

Or:

```bash
python -m agent.cli
```

## Observability Logs

The agent writes structured observability logs to a dedicated directory by default. Logs rotate hourly using UTC date-hour partitions, and historical log files older than 30 days are cleaned up automatically unless you override the retention window.

```text
logs/observability/events/YYYY-MM-DD/HH.jsonl
logs/observability/sessions/<session_id>/YYYY-MM-DD/HH.jsonl
```

The JSONL stream includes clearer stage-oriented events for:

- `command.received`, `command.completed`, and `command.blocked`
- `llm.response.completed` and `llm.loop_limit.exceeded`
- `tool.approval.requested` and `tool.approval.completed`
- `tool.execution.completed`
- `shell.execution.completed`

Lifecycle reference:

```text
user input
  -> command.received
     -> built-in command
        -> command.completed
     -> shell fallback
        -> command.blocked / shell.execution.completed
        -> command.completed
     -> llm loop
        -> llm.response.completed
        -> tool.approval.requested
        -> tool.approval.completed
        -> tool.execution.completed
        -> llm.loop_limit.exceeded (only when the loop cap is hit)
        -> command.completed
```

`command.received` is the entry event for a single user turn. It is emitted immediately after the input is normalized and before the agent branches into built-in handling, shell fallback, approval handling, or the LLM loop. `command.completed` closes that same user turn, while the LLM/tool/shell events describe intermediate stages inside the turn.

Each event timestamp is stored in UTC with millisecond precision for easier manual inspection.

Turn boundaries vs. inner stages:

- `command.received` and `command.completed` describe the outer lifecycle of one user turn.
- `llm.response.completed`, `tool.*`, `shell.execution.completed`, and `command.blocked` describe intermediate stages inside that turn.
- One user turn can contain multiple `llm.response.completed` or `tool.execution.completed` events, but it still starts with `command.received` and ends with `command.completed`.

Useful configuration:

```text
OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED=true
OBSERVABILITY_LOG_DIR=logs/observability
OBSERVABILITY_PREVIEW_CHARS=2000
OBSERVABILITY_RETENTION_HOURS=720
```

Useful inspection commands:

```bash
find logs/observability/events -type f | sort
find logs/observability/sessions -type f | sort
grep '"event_type": "llm.response.completed"' logs/observability/events/$(date -u +%F)/$(date -u +%H).jsonl
```

## Example Commands

Inside the interactive shell:

```text
agent> help
agent> read the README and summarize it
agent> create a file named notes.txt with three bullet points
agent> yes
agent> show me git status
agent> no
agent> exit
```

## AI-Agent-Friendly Conventions

This project is intentionally structured for machine readability and automation:

- Stable file layout
- Explicit module responsibilities
- Predictable command-line entrypoint
- Plain-text interaction contract
- Clear extension points for future tools, memory, or model integration
- Baseline safeguards for obviously destructive commands
- Structured runtime logging for debugging and inspection

## Roadmap

- Add command routing and intent parsing
- Add memory and conversation persistence
- Expand pluggable tool registry
- Add confirmation hooks on top of the current safety denylist
